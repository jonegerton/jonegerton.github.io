This was the model that started the project, when I found all my childhood lego in the attic at my parents house, along with the original box for the model (sadly not the instructions). Its the first Technic model I have any memory of.

It turned out that the model was almost complete, missing only the sticker, and one of the turntables for the steering, which was easily sourced on Brick Owl. The hinge needed super-gluing as it had broken at some point in the last 40 years or so!
