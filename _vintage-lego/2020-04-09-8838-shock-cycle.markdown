It was obvious even with all the old lego in a single box that I had most of the parts for the Shock Cycle, since the wheels and shocks absorbers were all easily found.

The Shock Cycle is quite a simple model. It's interesting to contrast this model with the newer [Technic Motocross Bike 42007](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=42007-1#T=I), which used the same shock absorber parts on the front forks. The more recent model certainly has an updated look to the back of the bike.
