This lego robot "transformer" was one of my favourite sets, and it's nice to see it back together. I still find the arms funny, with their lack of elbows.

The racks that extend the wheels do have a tendency to run slightly too far, and the arms need to be well out of the way so that they don't get trapped while transforming from robot to truck.

It's great that it is as complete as it is, with only a few parts from one arm missing at the moment.
